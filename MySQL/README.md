nodejs/myapp - backend, runs on port 9000
database is connected at http://localhost:9000/testAPI
for now, connection & query is at myapp/routes/testAPI.js
(can ignore db/index.js, it doesn't do anything)

react - frontend, runs on port 3000
client/src/App.js - where it's fetching data from backend through callAPI()
